The objective of the article is to give you a clear understanding on how to setup a login system in Node.js with MySQL database.We will be using Express Framework’s EJS which would render the html pages.We will also be using Passport.js for authentication and Express-session for session management.The strategy we would be implementing in Passport.js would be the local strategy.
